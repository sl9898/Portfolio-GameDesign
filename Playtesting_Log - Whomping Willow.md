# Whomping Willow Playtesting log

## 20241106 V0.2
### Changes
- Changed a lot of cards. lowered reach to 2. Integrated Tripped as ability of Root
(forgot to add a card with effect of "auto damage based on distance between willow and attacker")

### Test 2: vs Robin Hood; Sherwood Forest Map
- willow won at 7hp (starting 20hp)

### Test 3: vs Robin Hood; Yukon Map
	- adjusted willow starting hp to 18
	- willow won at 1 hp. Robin hood died from exhaustion 

### Playtest Notes
- The biggest issue is that spatial movements (both for the opponent and for manipulating the opponent) are very constrained and repetitive. Playability is a bit lackinh
- Should add the auto-damaged based on distance thing to encourage close attack
- Consider freeing up Root moving range to increase spatial ability. right now Root is now allowed to move only within reach
- Consider assigning more cards to Any or Root. this would give Willow player more flexibility. meanwhile 
- Need to increase the number of copies for bread-and-butter cards, and tailor rest of the cards to them
	- at least 3x of WHATâ€™S THAT UNDER THE TREE?
- Too many pure defense cards

## V0.1
### Test 1: vs Alice; Buffy map
- Willow close win against Alice
- Regrowth (and healing in general) too strong, needs nerf
